Update PhyWifiSim1.2 to ns3 v3.26

PhyWifiSim [1] is an IEEE 802.11 physical layer simulator for the NS-3 [2] network simulator. However, the current release of PhyWifiSim, version 1.2, hasn't been updated since NS-3, version 3.13, released on 23 December 2011. This project will update PhyWifiSim to be compatible with NS 3.26.

TODO: work is ongoing to upgrade it to ns-3-dev development branch [3] (on GitHub)
